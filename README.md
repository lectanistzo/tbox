However, to use RAD Studio 2010, you need a valid serial number that Embarcadero sends you via email after you purchase or request a trial version of the product.

So, what is Embarcadero RAD Studio 2010 serial number 12? This is a specific serial number that Embarcadero assigned to some customers who bought or requested a trial version of RAD Studio 2010. The serial number has the following format: HAAL-DANSGN-FZR5AG-M3BS. This serial number is valid for both Delphi and C++Builder editions of RAD Studio 2010.
     
If you have this serial number, you can use it to register your product using the Embarcadero Product Registration tool, which is a tool that handles your licenses of Embarcadero products such as RAD Studio. The tool provides different user interfaces, such as the Registration dialog box, the Registration wizard, and the License Manager. Depending on how you install RAD Studio 2010, you may see one or more of these interfaces during the installation process or after the installation is complete.
     
To register your product using the Registration dialog box, you need to enter your serial number, your EDN login name or email, and your EDN password. EDN stands for Embarcadero Developer Network, which is an online community for developers who use Embarcadero products. You need an EDN account to install RAD Studio 2010. If you do not have one, you can create one for free on the Embarcadero website. After you enter the required information, click Register to complete the registration.
     
To register your product using the Registration wizard, you can either activate a trial version of RAD Studio 2010 or register it using a serial number. To activate a trial version, you need to enter your email address and click Next. If your email matches an existing EDN account, Embarcadero will send you a serial number via email, and the Serial Number page will open. Otherwise, the New EDN Account page will open, where you can create a new EDN account. To register your product using a serial number, click "I have a serial number" on the Start page and enter your serial number on the Serial Number page. Then follow the instructions on the screen to complete the registration.

To register your product using the License Manager, you need to have a license file instead of a serial number. A license file is a file that contains information about your license, such as the product name, version, edition, expiration date, and so on. You can obtain a license file from Embarcadero or from an authorized reseller. To use the License Manager, click "I have a license file" on the Start page of the Registration wizard or open it from the Windows Start menu. Then click Add License File and browse to the location of your license file. Click Open to add the license file to the License Manager. Then select the license file from the list and click Activate License File to activate and register your product.
     
As you can see, there are different ways to register your product using Embarcadero RAD Studio 2010 serial number 12 or other methods. Once you register your product successfully, you can enjoy all the benefits and features of RAD Studio 2010 and create amazing applications for various platforms.
